My doctoral research as a Bilsland Fellow at Purdue University operates at the confluence of process systems engineering, industrial ecology, and machine learning to develop solutions for systemic sustainability challenges. This work delivers novel methodologies for dynamic carbon accounting and the multi-objective optimization of circular industrial networks.</p> <p>My technical toolkit includes hybrid surrogate modeling, economy-wide material flow analysis, techno-economic assessment, and reverse logistics optimization. These methods are applied to design industrial systems that simultaneously minimize environmental footprints and maximize economic viability. This research has produced over four peer-reviewed publications, numerous international conference presentations, and has been recognized by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).</p> <p>My goal is to collaborate with forward-thinking teams to translate complex socio-technical challenges into robust, actionable strategies that forge a more resilient and sustainable industrial future.</p> <p>Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture.
